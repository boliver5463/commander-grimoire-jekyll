Some cards seem really good, but are only good when you are ahead
- Sultai value X spell
- Chandra's Ignition
- Doubling Season & friends may double tokens, but you could just add cards that create more token without the help?
- Finale of Devastation is a good card and provides a way to win the game
- Thousand-Year Storm

Power. It is common for players to want to seek it out. They will search through the immense card catalog that MTG provides, hoping to find a new diamond in the rough. Sometimes they will find a gem, but sometimes it is a trap.

## What is a 'Win-More' Card?
A simple definition of a 'Win-More' card is that it is a card that is very powerful but only when you are already ahead in the game, sometimes needing the game to be in a specific state, usually doing nothing on their own. They can be very tricky to identify, especially with newly released cards. Knowning how to identify a card's floor and ceiling can help.

Why are 'Win-More' cards bad though? They can be a hinderance when tuning a commander deck. Being a 100-card singleton format and a multiplayer format, your deck wants to have as few dud cards to account for a majority of situations. For example, if you have a game ending spell but don't have the means to use it, it will just stay in your hand and do nothing.

They can be very tricky to identify. Even veteran players can have trouble identifying them.

## Common 'Win-More' Examples
[Doubling Season image]
Doubling Season is a favourite card among players who like to create tokens. It's a 5-mana spell that doesn't nothing initially. It only starts to provide value if your token generation is working as intended. If you can't make any tokens, you have a 5-mana spell that does nothing. You may just rather want a card that could produces by itself or help your existing tokens straight away.

(((something that isn't a win-more card like Doubling Season)))

[Chandra's Ignition image, prefer an easier to achieve burn boardwipe like Brothers War 3-mana red board wipe and artifact destroy]

A big flashy burn spell is Chandra's Ignition. It can win the game outright in the right conditions. However with everyone starting the game at 40 live, it requires a high-powered creature to be effective on your opponents life totals, with the hope that your opponents don't remove it.

It could be used to kill players if they have lower life totals, but that makes it's use case more unlikely. Most of the time the spell would just be an overcosted boardwipe. You may have a better time using Brotherhood's End as it is less to cast and can be used to help remove artifacts if need be.

Another 'Win-More' example would be Thousand-Year Storm. Being a 6 mana spell, it is already a card that requires a heavy investment. Although for how much it costs, it has a very powerful effect in making your instant and sorceries essentially have storm. Yet that is where the card starts to fall short.

The problem with the enchantment is the investment you need to have it start working for you, both mana and cards. First you need 6 mana to play the card. Many decks would have to wait a turn to untap their mana back after playing the card before they can start utilising it.

Next you need a second instant and/or sorceries that you have cast that turn to have it trigger. After waiting a turn to untap your lands, you will need to cast 2 spells to have the enchantment trigger even once. At that point you have to consider, is 6 mana worth the cost of duplicating a single spell? After that point, your 3rd instant/sorcery and onwards starts multiplying, but that also requires you have more and more cards in your hand. Because of the entire setup needed to get this card working, this is what we would call a 'Win-More' card.

## 'Win-More' Cards Aren't All Downsides
Even though 'Win-More' cards can be a hunderance, they are usually good for providing spiky plays and/or unique gameplay.

The main reason why they are usually considered traps are because they don't work in most situations. When tunning your deck to handle most situations, you want as few dud cards as possible. Usually when building a deck this way, you want to stay away from 'Win-More' cards.

Not everyone wants to play highly synergistic decks though. Some people like their big plays and that's not a bad thing.
