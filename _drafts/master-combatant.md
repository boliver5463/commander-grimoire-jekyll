Priority during combat
- End Step of the combat phase for stuff like Reconnaissance and Ninjutsu
- A lot of confusion with combat tricks

Examples:
- Kaalia of the Vast (Tapped & Attacking)
- Yuriko (Ninjutsu after blockers are declared)
- Najeela (When can you use her ability, including after damage has been done)
